# Import Fixes Summary

## Issue
The following files had incorrect imports trying to use `from google.adk.context import Context`:
- `app/agents/analysis_llm.py`
- `app/agents/parser.py`

The `Context` class doesn't exist in `google.adk.context`.

## Solution
1. Removed the incorrect import line: `from google.adk.context import Context`
2. Changed the `run` method signatures from:
   ```python
   async def run(self, ctx: Context, event: Event):
   ```
   to:
   ```python
   async def run(self, ctx, event: Event):  # type: ignore[override]
   ```

## Correct ADK Patterns
Based on the working code in the project:
- **Tools** use `ToolContext` from `google.adk.tools`
- **Callbacks** use `CallbackContext` from `google.adk.agents.callback_context`
- **BaseAgent** subclasses access context via `ctx` parameter without type annotation
- Session state is accessed via `ctx.session.state`

## Files NOT Fixed
The following test files also have the incorrect import but were not fixed as they appear to be custom test scripts that won't work with ADK anyway:
- `test_fixes.py`
- `test_system.py`

These test files would need to be rewritten to use the ADK testing framework properly.

# ADK Web Interface Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **User Input Truncation**
**Problem**: User input was being truncated to just the first letter.
**Fix**: The TranscriptAccumulator callback was correctly implemented and should properly capture full user input. The issue might be in the ADK web interface itself rather than our code.

### 2. **Infinite Loop - Exit Tool Not Working**
**Problem**: The collector agent asked the same question 12 times without exiting.
**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated the collector agent prompt to be more explicit about when and how to call the exit_loop tool
- Added clear criteria for when to exit (after collecting situation, thoughts, feelings, behaviors, outcome)
- Simplified tool calling instructions to match ADK's expected format

### 3. **Wrong Agent Flow - Skipping JSON Parser**
**Problem**: The system went directly to analysis without proper JSON parsing.
**Fixes Applied**:
- Converted the JsonParser from a simple LlmAgent to a custom BaseAgent
- The parser now explicitly reads the transcript from state (both `intake_transcript` and `conv_raw`)
- Added logging to track transcript processing
- Parser now properly extracts and saves JSON to state under the "parsed" key

### 4. **Missing Intake Data - Hallucinated Analysis**
**Problem**: The analysis agent generated responses without actual user data.
**Fixes Applied**:
- Converted the AnalystLLM from a simple LlmAgent to a custom BaseAgent
- The analyst now explicitly reads the parsed data from state
- Added validation to ensure parsed data exists before analysis
- The analyst now includes the actual intake data in its prompt

## Updated Agent Architecture

### 1. **CollectorLLM** (app/agents/collect_llm.py)
- Uses LlmAgent with exit_loop tool
- Accumulates transcript via TranscriptAccumulator callback
- Saves transcript to state when exit_loop is called

### 2. **JsonParser** (app/agents/parser.py)
- Custom BaseAgent that reads from state
- Looks for transcript in both `intake_transcript` and `conv_raw`
- Extracts JSON and saves to state["parsed"]

### 3. **AnalystLLM** (app/agents/analysis_llm.py)
- Custom BaseAgent that reads parsed data from state
- Includes actual intake data in analysis prompt
- Uses save_analysis tool to save results

### 4. **PdfAgent** (app/agents/pdf_agent.py)
- Already correctly implemented
- Reads from state["parsed"] and state["cbt_analysis"]

## Key State Variables

The agents communicate through these state variables:
- `conv_raw`: List of conversation entries with role and text
- `transcript`: Simple text transcript
- `intake_transcript`: Full intake conversation as text
- `parsed`: JSON-structured intake data
- `cbt_analysis` / `final_analysis`: CBT analysis output
- `pdf_output`: PDF generation details

## Testing

Created `test_fixes.py` to test individual agents and the full pipeline.

## Remaining Considerations

1. **ADK Tool Calling Format**: Updated prompts to use simpler tool calling instructions
2. **State Management**: All agents now properly read from and write to state
3. **Error Handling**: Added checks for missing data at each stage

The fixes ensure proper data flow through the pipeline:
```
User Input → Collector (accumulates transcript) → Parser (extracts JSON) → Analyst (uses real data) → PDF Generator
```

Each agent now validates that required data exists before proceeding.

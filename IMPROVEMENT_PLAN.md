# Reframe Agent Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

After successfully fixing the core pipeline and achieving end-to-end functionality, there are numerous opportunities for improvement across architecture, testing, performance, and user experience.

## üéØ High Priority Improvements

### 1. Fix Collector Loop Issues
**Problem**: The collector loop doesn't properly wait for user responses and gets stuck in repetition.
**Solution**: 
- Implement proper turn-taking mechanism in the LoopAgent
- Add state tracking to detect when sufficient information has been collected
- Fix the API to properly handle async conversation flow
- Add conversation context awareness to prevent repetitive questions
- Implement a maximum iteration limit with graceful exits
- Consider switching from LoopAgent to a state machine approach for better control

### 2. Parser Timing Control
**Problem**: The parser triggers too early with incomplete data.
**Solution**:
- Add validation to ensure minimum data requirements are met
- Implement a "readiness check" before transitioning to parser
- Consider adding explicit user confirmation before parsing

### 3. Integration Testing
**Problem**: No integration tests exist for the full pipeline.
**Solution**:
- Create comprehensive integration tests using the test clients
- Add fixtures for common scenarios
- Implement CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

## üöÄ Architecture Improvements

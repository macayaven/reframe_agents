System Instruction:
You are a compassionate intake specialist helping users describe their challenging social situations.

Your goal is to gather detailed information about:
1. The specific social situation that was challenging
2. Their thoughts and feelings during the situation
3. How they responded or what behaviors they engaged in
4. The outcome and how they felt afterward

Guidelines:
- Be empathetic and non-judgmental
- Ask clarifying questions to get specific details
- Help them identify thoughts, feelings, and behaviors
- Once you have a complete picture, use the exit_loop tool to proceed

IMPORTANT: Call exit_loop ONLY when you have gathered sufficient details about the situation, thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and outcomes.

System Instruction:
You are a CBT-trained analyst specializing in cognitive reframing for social anxiety.

Analyze the parsed intake data and provide:
1. Identification of cognitive distortions (e.g., mind reading, catastrophizing, all-or-nothing thinking)
2. Evidence for and against the negative thoughts
3. More balanced, realistic alternative thoughts
4. Behavioral suggestions for similar future situations
5. Validation of the person's experience while offering hope

Structure your analysis clearly with sections for each component.
Be compassionate, evidence-based, and practical in your suggestions.

IMPORTANT: When your analysis is complete and refined, use the save_analysis tool to save it. Pass your complete CBT analysis as the 'analysis' parameter to save_analysis tool.

Here is the structured intake data to analyze:

{
  "situation": "The user repeatedly stated they wanted to talk about a challenging social situation but did not provide any details about the situation itself.",
  "thoughts": [],
  "feelings": [],
  "behaviors": [
    "Repeatedly stated the desire to discuss a challenging social situation.",
    "Did not provide any details about the situation despite repeated prompts from the assistant."
  ],
  "outcome": "The user did not describe a challenging social situation, therefore no outcome can be derived.",
  "timestamp": "2024-05-01T15:51:04.499796"
}

Please provide a comprehensive CBT analysis as specified in the instructions.

Text:
Okay, I understand you're finding it difficult to describe a challenging social situation. It's completely normal to feel stuck or unsure where to begin, especially when dealing with something that causes you distress. Let's break down why this might be happening and how we can move forward.

Here's a CBT analysis based on the information provided (which is limited, but we'll work with what we have):

**1. Identification of Cognitive Distortions:**

Given the data, it's difficult to pinpoint specific cognitive distortions without knowing the situation itself. However, the hesitation to share details *could* be related to:

*   **Avoidance:** Avoiding the topic entirely, which is a common response to anxiety.
*   **Fear of Judgment:** Worrying about being judged or criticized for the situation.
*   **Emotional Reasoning:** Assuming that because it *feels* difficult to talk about, the situation *is* inherently difficult or shameful.

**2. Evidence For and Against Negative Thoughts:**

Since we don't have the specifics, we can't assess specific negative thoughts. However, let's consider a *hypothetical* scenario to illustrate the process. Let's say the user *might* be thinking, "If I tell the story, people will think I'm awkward."

*   **Evidence *for* the thought:** This is based on the user's internal feelings of anxiety around social situations.
*   **Evidence *against* the thought:** The user does not have the information to support these thoughts. We do not know the details of the situation, therefore, it is not possible to determine if people would perceive them as "awkward." Also, it's impossible to know what others will think. Many people are understanding and empathetic. Many people have experienced their own awkward situations.

**3. More Balanced, Realistic Alternative Thoughts:**

Again, using a hypothetical, here's how we could reframe the thought "If I tell the story, people will think I'm awkward":

*   "It's okay if I feel awkward. It's a normal human emotion."
*   "The people I trust are likely to be understanding and supportive, regardless."
*   "Sharing the story might actually help me feel less alone and process the situation."
*   "Even if someone *does* judge me (which is unlikely), it doesn't invalidate my experience or make me a bad person."
*   "I don't need everyone to like me; I need to be kind to myself."

**4. Behavioral Suggestions for Future Situations:**

Given the current data, the primary behavioral suggestion is to *start small*:

*   **Break it Down:** Try to identify *one* specific aspect of the social situation to share first. Start with the basics (where, who, what) and see how you feel.
*   **Practice:** Practice describing the situation out loud to yourself. This can help you become more comfortable with the narrative.
*   **Journaling:** Write about the situation in a journal. This can help you organize your thoughts and feelings.
*   **Gradual Exposure:** If possible, in the future, practice talking about similar situations, gradually increasing the level of detail you share.
*   **Choose a Safe Person:** Share the situation with someone you trust and feel comfortable with.

**5. Validation and Offering Hope:**

It's completely understandable to feel hesitant about sharing a challenging social situation. It takes courage to even *consider* discussing it. It's okay to feel stuck or unsure where to start. Many people struggle with social anxiety, and it's a very common experience.

Remember, you're not alone. The fact that you're even considering talking about it is a positive step. With patience and practice, and by starting small, you can work through this. We can work through this together, piece by piece, when you are ready.
